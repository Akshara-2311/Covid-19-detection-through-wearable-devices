# Covid-19 Management Using Wearable Sensors:
Consider you are an expert assigned to create an interface with sensor readings to 
detect Covid-19. So, in that imaginary world, everyone has to wear bands with 
sensors to identify covid-19.

The following are specifications:
  • Sensor Readings: The wearable band uses different sensors that identify 
  temperature, audio sensor, pulse oximeter etc. (you can choose any sensor 
  based on its relevance in detecting covid-19) to identify strong coughing and 
  pulse variations etc. to name a few. 
  
  • Remedial measures for those identified with high probability: Give 
  instructions on contacting medical services and precautions to be taken.
  
  • Remedial measures for those identified with medium probability: Give 
  instructions on personal care, health check-up, social distancing etc.
  
Consider the scenario and implement in Flowgorithm. Perform the following:
  1. Find out the number of persons with high temperature based on the standard 
  temperature score.
  
  2. Collect the day-wise details of people residing in a geographical area (say for a 
  week). Find out the count of persons who are ill (decide the condition for 
  illness) is increasing day-by-day. So that you can predict the severity of the 
  disease.
  
  3. Covid-19 probability detection: Bases on the readings from these sensors, you 
  have to indicate the probability of a person to have covid-19, which can be 
  predicted using scales such as “high probability”, “medium probability”,” low 
  probability”
